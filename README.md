Welcome to this data analysis and visualization project! In this repository, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of Airbnb data for a specific city. Our goal is to explore and gain insights from the data, and we have performed various data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization tasks.

## Introduction

Insideairbnb.com is a valuable source of data extracted from city websites, and we have collected data related to Airbnb listings in the city. This dataset includes information on listings, hosts, pricing, reviews, and more.

## Data Preprocessing

We have carefully preprocessed the data, which involved the following steps:

- Handling missing data by removing columns with excessive null values and imputing missing values based on variable types.
- Addressing outliers to ensure data quality and accuracy.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Our EDA phase includes the following key analyses:

- Examining neighborhoods with the most listings on the platform.
- Calculating average prices by neighborhood.
- Analyzing property types and accommodations.
- Investigating the popularity of listings for different group sizes.
- Identifying hosts with the most listings and their geographic distribution.
- Calculating the average price for two people by neighborhood.
- Visualizing average prices on maps.
- Exploring the relationship between location ratings and average prices.

## Superhost Analysis

We investigate the number of Superhosts and assess whether achieving Superhost status is worthwhile for hosts.

## Calendar and Pricing Analysis

We use the calendar data to observe availability and pricing trends in the upcoming months.

## Sentiment Analysis

We perform sentiment analysis on comments to identify the most commonly mentioned words related to stays in the city.

## Climatic Data

We scrape climatic data from Wikipedia to enrich our analysis with weather information.

## Data Export

We export our cleaned and analyzed data into CSV format for use in data visualization tools like PowerBI.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide valuable insights into the Airbnb market in the city. We encourage you to explore the code and findings in our Jupyter notebooks and data visualizations in PowerBI.
